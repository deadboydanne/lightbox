lightbox
========

Usage
-----

This lightbox is at the moment in a very early stage of development but is however working very well with the single purpose of viewing the images of your choise in a lightbox.

installation
------------

Download the files from github, then you include `lightbox.js` and `lightbox.css` into your header.
here is an example on how you include the files:

```
   <script src="lightbox/lightbox.js"></script>
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lightbox/lightbox.css">
```

once you have included the files you simply add a `<a>` tag to your page and add `class="lightbox"` in it and make it link to an image.
Now once you click on the link the image appears in a lightbox.
